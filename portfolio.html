    <p>The development process of remixing the scratch platform program was very interesting. We first wanted to change the character from scratch cat to the Pico character we have now, it was really difficult at first because there was so much code to decipher through and we didn’t know what did what at first. We added code to kill the Giga-v monsters. At first we made the Giga-v monsters unable to kill the character, but we were able to kill it by touching it and pressing the spacebar. We decided that the game was too easy that way and made it so that the Giga-v monster could still kill you, but you could kill it using a gun. That brought on a set of problems that we managed to overcome. At first we couldn’t figure out how to add the gun to our character sprites, because the Pico character would always stay in front of the gun, so we were forced to make the gun a different sprite. This was hard because we had to move the gun on the canvas in different ways to move it on the character. Then we added code to make sure the gun always stayed with the character throughout the game. We also made it so the character had a certain number of lives, and when it hit 0, it was game over for the character. We decided to implement a score system where if the character killed the Giga-v monster, it would get points, and we made coins that were worth one point when you collected it. We also added more levels, including a lava level and a zombie level. Our work was very collaborative because we devised a system where both people were able to work at the same time. One person would be signed into the account working on something, while the other would be not signed in the account, but working on a different sprite or playing the game looking for bugs. The first person would save their work and log off, then the other person would sign in to the account, and save their work. I mainly worked on the coding aspect, while my partner did most of the design work, but we did switch off at different points of the project.</p>

	<h2>Hell game</h2>
	<p>Characters:
		1. Uranus Is Blue- recently dead main character. 
		2. Satan- ruler of hell. His friends call him Pistachio.
		3. Satan’s advisors- Satan’s advisors who plot to overthrow Satan.
		4. God- The ruler of Heaven.
		5. God’s Angel(s)- The Angel(s) that serve God.
		6. Satan’s Hellhound- Pistachio's narrator when he first arrives at hell.
		Story
		In the beginning . . .
		Uranus wakes up in a bloody pit and stares into the dark void.
 		 Uranus: Where am I?
		Suddenly a hellhound appears slowly from the shadows of the pit.
 		 Hellhound: You're in hell.
		Uranus screams and tries to run away from the beast.
  		 Hellhound: WAIT!!!!!! I have answers to your questions Uranus.
 		 Uranus: Wait! What? How do you know my name?
 		 Hellhound: I know everything. I know that you are a wimp who was bullied and I know how you died.
		 Uranus: How I died. How did I die?
		 Hellhound: Do you really want to know. It is hilariously embarrassing. 
		 Uranus: *Make decision whether to view death flashback*
			Death Flashback:
				You were cornered by your usual bullies, when they noticed you buying some medical marijuana from your dealer. They wanted to take your drugs, but you were uncharacteristically obstinate and refused. One of them starts strangling you so you would release the drugs. You kept on clenching the bag of weed like it is your lifeline. Your vision starts to tunnel and the last thing you hear is “ Wow, Uranus is turning really blue.”
 
 		 Hellhound: So because you were equally good as you were bad, your actions and decisions will determine whether you will stay in Hell, or go to Heaven. Go forth and make your decisions. 

		*The rest of the story is adequately portrayed in the attached Flowchart of the Hell game.*
