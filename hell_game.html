	<h1>Hell game</h1>
	<h2>Characters:</h2>
	<p>		1. Uranus Is Blue- recently dead main character.</p> 
	<p>		2. Satan- ruler of hell. His friends call him Pistachio.</p>
	<p>		3. Satan’s advisors- Satan’s advisors who plot to overthrow Satan.</p>
	<p>		4. God- The ruler of Heaven.</p>
	<p>		5. God’s Angel(s)- The Angel(s) that serve God.</p>
	<p>		6. Satan’s Hellhound- Pistachio's narrator when he first arrives at hell.</p>
	<h2>Story</h2>
	<p>	In the beginning . . .</p>
	<p>	Uranus wakes up in a bloody pit and stares into the dark void.</p>
 	<p>	 	Uranus: Where am I?</p>
	<p>	Suddenly a hellhound appears slowly from the shadows of the pit.</p>
 	<p>		 Hellhound: You're in hell.</p>
	<p>	Uranus screams and tries to run away from the beast.</p>
  	<p>		 Hellhound: WAIT!!!!!! I have answers to your questions Uranus.</p>
 	<p>		 Uranus: Wait! What? How do you know my name?</p>
 	<p>		 Hellhound: I know everything. I know that you are a wimp who was bullied and I know how you died.</p>
	<p>		 Uranus: How I died. How did I die?</p>
	<p>	 	 Hellhound: Do you really want to know. It is hilariously embarrassing.</p> 
	<p>		 Uranus: *Make decision whether to view death flashback*</p>
	<p>			Death Flashback:</p>
	<p>			You were cornered by your usual bullies, when they noticed you buying some medical marijuana from your dealer. They wanted to take your drugs, but you were uncharacteristically obstinate and refused. One of them starts strangling you so you would release the drugs. You kept on clenching the bag of weed like it is your lifeline. Your vision starts to tunnel and the last thing you hear is “ Wow, Uranus is turning really blue.”</p>
 
 	<p>	 	 Hellhound: So because you were equally good as you were bad, your actions and decisions will determine whether you will stay in Hell, or go to Heaven. Go forth and make your decisions.</p>

	<p>	*The rest of the story is adequately portrayed in the attached Flowchart of the Hell game.*</p>
	<h2>Written Response</h2>
	<p>The development process of creating the python game in repl.it was very interesting.
	When we were creating the accompanying flowchart, we ran out of room, so we had to create a few additional documents.
	When we actually started coding, we ran into a couple problems because we decided to do the program in Python 3, not realizing that the format would be different than the example in google docs.
	We just googled things as we went and everything went fine from there.
	We were originally going to incorporate statistics for the character, but we realized that that would take a lot of work and we didn’t have the time so we cut it out of the program.
	The development was somewhat collaborative.
	I created the flowchart, but we both came up with the storyline, and while programming the game we created two different sessions and coded different parts of the game.
	I programmed the bad side and the introduction, while Marcus programmed the good side.
	We then added it all onto one session and made sure that the program didn’t have any bugs.
	We also created a shared google docs where we could put the links on so we could both access each others code.</p>
